  <p>Henri Émile Benoît Matisse (French: [ɑ̃ʁi emil bənwɑ matis];
     31 December 1869 – 3 November 1954) was a French artist,
      known for both his use of colour and his fluid and
       original draughtsmanship. He was a draughtsman, printmaker,
       and sculptor, but is known primarily as a painter.
       Matisse is commonly regarded, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso" target="_blank" title="wikipedia">Pablo Picasso</a>,
        as one of the artists who best helped to define the revolutionary
        developments in the visual arts throughout the opening decades
         of the twentieth century, responsible for significant
         developments in painting and sculpture.
